abstract = {MANY mathematical and applied problems can be reduced to finding some common point of a system (finite or infinite) of convex sets. Usually each of the sets is such that it is not difficult to find the projection of any point on to this set. In this paper we shall consider various methods of finding points from the intersection of sets, using projection on to a separate set as an elementary operation. The strong convergence of the sequences obtained in this way is proved. Applications are given to various problems, including the problem of best approximation and problems of optimal control. Particular attention is paid in the latter case to problems with restrictions on the phase coordinates.}
