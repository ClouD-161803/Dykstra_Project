Le but de ce texte est de montrer comment les problèmes importants de la théorie de systèmes linéaires peuvent être résulus concisément pour une classe particulière de systèmes linéaires, les systèmes de circulation en block, en exploitant la structure algébrique.

Zusammenfassung
Diese Arbeit soll zeigen, wie die wichtigen Probleme der Theorie linearer Systeme für eine spezielle Klasse linearer Systeme, nämlich “block circulant systems” gelöst werden können, indem die algebraische Struktur ausgenutzt wird. Dieser Typ von Systemen tritt bei der Approximation linearer partieller Differentialgleichungen unter Verwendung konzentrierter Parameter auf. Die Berechnung der Transitionsmatrix, Beobachtbarkeit, Steuerbarkeit, Polanordnung, Theorie der Realisierung, Stabilität und quadratische optimale Steuerung werden diskutiert. Im Prinzip könnten alle hier gelösten Fragen auch durch Standard-Methoden behandelt werden. Diese Arbeit legt die Struktur der Lösung frei und erlaubt so verschiedene Einsparungen in Bezug auf den Rechenaufwand.

  Abstract                 = {It is proved that the eigenvectors of a symmetric centrosymmetric matrix of order N are either symmetric or skew symmetric, and that there are ⌈N/2⌉ symmetric and ⌊N/2⌋ skew symmetric eigenvectors. Some previously known but widely scattered facts about symmetric centrosymmetric matrices are presented for completeness. Special cases are considered, in particular tridiagonal matrices of both odd and even order, for which it is shown that the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues arranged in descending order are alternately symmetric and skew symmetric provided the eigenvalues are distinct.},

  Abstract                 = {Cross-directional control systems have been installed on a wide range of web processes, and many of these systems use an array of actuators to control cross-directional variations. This paper investigates the controllable bandwidth of these systems by using the concept of spatial frequencies to separate the controllable and uncontrollable components of a cross-directional disturbance. This leads to an expression for the spatial bandwidths of the whole array in terms of the spatial-frequency response of a single actuator. The analysis is closely related to Shannon's sampling theory, and a phenomenon similar to aliasing occurs when the spacing between the actuators is too large. A practical specification for the design of an array of actuators is given in terms of the spatial bandwidth of an individual actuator.},

Therefore, applications of Douglas---Rachford splitting, such as the alternating direction method of multipliers for convex programming decomposition, are also special cases of the proximal point algorithm. This observation allows the unification and generalization of a variety of convex programming algorithms. By introducing a modified version of the proximal point algorithm, we derive a new,generalized alternating direction method of multipliers for convex programming. Advances of this sort illustrate the power and generality gained by adopting monotone operator theory as a conceptual framework.},

  Abstract                 = {We refer to Model Predictive Control (MPC) as that family of controllers in which there is a direct use of an explicit and separately identifiable model. Control design methods based on the MPC concept have found wide acceptance in industrial applications and have been studied by academia. The reason for such popularity is the ability of MPC designs to yield high performance control systems capable of operating without expert intervention for long periods of time. In this paper the issues of importance that any control system should address are stated. MPC techniques are then reviewed in the light of these issues in order to point out their advantages in design and implementation. A number of design techniques emanating from MPC, namely Dynamic Matrix Control, Model Algorithmic Control, Inferential Control and Internal Model Control, are put in perspective with respect to each other and the relation to more traditional methods like Linear Quadratic Control is examined. The flexible constraint handling capabilities of MPC are shown to be a significant advantage in the context of the overall operating objectives of the process industries and the 1-, 2-, and ∞-norm formulations of the performance objective are discussed. The application of MPC to non-linear systems is examined and it is shown that its main attractions carry over. Finally, it is explained that though MPC is not inherently more or less robust than classical feedback, it can be adjusted more easily for robustness.},

  Abstract                 = {By accelerating electrons to relativistic speeds, synchrotrons generate extremely intense and narrow beams of electromagnetic light that are used for academic research and commercial development across a range of scientific disciplines. In order to achieve optimum performance, the stability of the electron beam is a crucial parameter for synchrotrons and is achieved by a beam stabilisation system that is used to control the location of the electron beam and minimise any instability of the electron beam caused by external disturbances. Slew rate limits are common nonlinearities encountered with the actuators in synchrotron feedback systems which can impose significant limitations on the robustness and the performance of the control system. This paper describes an Internal Model Control (IMC) based anti-windup synthesis using an algebraic Riccati equation for a discrete-time control system to compensate against the performance deterioration in the presence of rate constraints. An Integral Quadratic Constraint (IQC) framework is used to analyse the robust stability of the anti-windup augmented closed loop system in the presence of norm-bounded uncertainty. The anti-windup augmented controller is implemented at Diamond Light Source, the UK’s national synchrotron facility and improvements in robustness and performance were achieved with respect to the use of no anti-windup compensation.},

The relationship between the actuators and sensors used for electron beam control in synchrotrons is modelled as a static response matrix which is typically ill-conditioned. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is commonly used to invert the response matrix and modes associated with small singular values are either discarded or filtered. In this paper, a robust control approach is used to determine the optimal static controller to the perturbed system. It is demonstrated how this approach compares to the use of Tikhonov regularisation for an inverse-based controller. A detailed example from the Diamond Light Source synchrotron is presented, applying both the inverse-based method and the robust control approach to stabilise electron beam motion.},

  Abstract                 = {The cross-directional behaviour of web forming processes can be represented in terms of orthogonal basis functions. By choosing a suitable basis set, it is possible to separate controllable and uncontrollable components of the profile into low- and high-order spectral components and hence obtain a parsimonious representation. In most cases if there are sufficient actuators to control all low-order spectral components then the interaction matrix is likely to be ill-conditioned, which necessitates the incorporation of input constraints into the control design. The representation in terms of orthogonal functions allows the design of finite-horizon predictive controllers with hard inequality constraints on the input that are computationally feasible for commercial machines. It is also possible to exploit such a representation to construct efficient estimators for the process.},

  Abstract                 = {Plant structure is utilized for the simplification of system analysis and controller synthesis. For plants where the directionality is independent of frequency, the singular-value decompositioin (SVD) is used to decouple the system into nominally independent subsystems of lower dimension. In H2− and H∞−optimal control, the controller synthesis can then be performed for each of these subsystems independently, and the resulting overall SVD controller will be optimal (the same will hold for any norm that is invariant under unitary transformations). In H∞−optimal control the resulting controller is also super-optimal, since a controller of dimension n × n will minimize the norm in n directions. For robust control in terms of the structured singular value μ, the SVD controller is optimal for a practically relevant class of block-diagonal structures and uncertainty and performance weights.},

  Abstract                 = {The cross-machine-direction (CD) control problem in paper machines is analysed from the viewpoint of robust performance. The objective of robust performance is to maintain control system stability and to satisfy a bound on the maximum singular value of the closed-loop sensitivity function despite modelling error. Characteristics common to all CD response control problems including paper basis-weight control are identified. The response of an important actuator for basis-weight control, the paper machine slice, is described by a single dimensionless design parameter that provides considerable insight about the CD response control problem. Sufficient conditions allowing design of robust diagonal controllers are developed. Robust stability, performance and failure tolerance properties of the controllers are proven.},

  Abstract                 = {We suggest a form for, and give a constructive derivation of, the generalized singular value decomposition of any two matrices having the same number of columns. We outline its desirable characteristics and compare it to an earlier suggestion by Van Loan [SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 13 (1976), pp. 76-83]. The present form largely follows from the work of Van Loan, but is slightly more general and computationally more amenable than that in the paper cited. We also prove a useful extension of a theorem of Stewart [SIAM Rev. 19 (1977), pp. 634-662] on unitary decompositions of submatrices of a unitary matrix.},

  Abstract                 = {The number of high-dimensional datasets recording multiple aspects of a single phenomenon is increasing in many areas of science, accompanied by a need for mathematical frameworks that can compare multiple large-scale matrices with different row dimensions. The only such framework to date, the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD), is limited to two matrices. We mathematically define a higher-order GSVD (HO GSVD) for N≥2 matrices , each with full column rank. Each matrix is exactly factored as Di = UiΣiVT, where V, identical in all factorizations, is obtained from the eigensystem SV = VΛ of the arithmetic mean S of all pairwise quotients of the matrices , i≠j. We prove that this decomposition extends to higher orders almost all of the mathematical properties of the GSVD. The matrix S is nondefective with V and Λ real. Its eigenvalues satisfy λk≥1. Equality holds if and only if the corresponding eigenvector vk is a right basis vector of equal significance in all matrices Di and Dj, that is σi,k/σj,k = 1 for all i and j, and the corresponding left basis vector ui,k is orthogonal to all other vectors in Ui for all i. The eigenvalues λk = 1, therefore, define the “common HO GSVD subspace.” We illustrate the HO GSVD with a comparison of genome-scale cell-cycle mRNA expression from S. pombe, S. cerevisiae and human. Unlike existing algorithms, a mapping among the genes of these disparate organisms is not required. We find that the approximately common HO GSVD subspace represents the cell-cycle mRNA expression oscillations, which are similar among the datasets. Simultaneous reconstruction in the common subspace, therefore, removes the experimental artifacts, which are dissimilar, from the datasets. In the simultaneous sequence-independent classification of the genes of the three organisms in this common subspace, genes of highly conserved sequences but significantly different cell-cycle peak times are correctly classified.},

With emittances approaching 1nm rad this typically requires sub micrometer positional stability at the source point over time scales from milliseconds to at least hours and ideally much longer. These challenges are routinely met by the use of fast orbit feedback systems. This contribution sets out to first establish a relevant representation of stability over many orders of magnitude in time and looks at available stable references. To complement this, data on the electron and X-ray beam stability achieved at various operational light sources is compared.},

This paper reviews recent developments in sheet and film process control with particular attention to the effectiveness of existing techniques at addressing the critical aspects of sheet and film processes.},

  Abstract                 = {Gene co-expression networks are increasingly used to explore the system-level functionality of genes. The network construction is conceptually straightforward: nodes represent genes and nodes are connected if the corresponding genes are significantly co-expressed across appropriately chosen tissue samples. In reality, it is tricky to define the connections between the nodes in such networks. An important question is whether it is biologically meaningful to encode gene co-expression using binary information (connected=1, unconnected=0). We describe a general framework for ;soft' thresholding that assigns a connection weight to each gene pair. This leads us to define the notion of a weighted gene co-expression network. For soft thresholding we propose several adjacency functions that convert the co-expression measure to a connection weight. For determining the parameters of the adjacency function, we propose a biologically motivated criterion (referred to as the scale-free topology criterion). We generalize the following important network concepts to the case of weighted networks. First, we introduce several node connectivity measures and provide empirical evidence that they can be important for predicting the biological significance of a gene. Second, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the ;weighted' topological overlap measure (used to define gene modules) leads to more cohesive modules than its ;unweighted' counterpart. Third, we generalize the clustering coefficient to weighted networks. Unlike the unweighted clustering coefficient, the weighted clustering coefficient is not inversely related to the connectivity. We provide a model that shows how an inverse relationship between clustering coefficient and connectivity arises from hard thresholding. We apply our methods to simulated data, a cancer microarray data set, and a yeast microarray data set.},
