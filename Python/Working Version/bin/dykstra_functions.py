"""
This module implements Dykstra's algorithm for projecting a point onto the
intersection of convex sets (specifically, half-spaces).

Functions:
- normalise(normal, offset):
    Normalises half space normal and constant offset.
- is_in_half_space(point, unit_normal, constant_offset):
    Checks if a point lies within a single half-space.
- project_onto_half_space(point, normal, offset):
    Projects a given point onto a single half-space.
- delete_inactive_half_spaces(z, N, c):
    Deletes inactive half-spaces and returns updated matrices.
- find_optimal_solution(point, N, c, dimensions: int):
    Computes the projection using QP optimisation (quadprog)
- beta_check(point, N, c):
    Selects a value of beta based on whether the point lies within the
    intersection of half-spaces.

    Solves a quadratic programming problem to find the optimal solution that
    minimises the Euclidean distance between a given point and a target,
    subject to linear constraints.

    The function solves the following optimisation problem:
    min_x ∥x − point∥^2 subject to Gx <= h, where G and h represent
    the constraints.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    point : A 1D array representing the target point in space for the
            optimisation.

    N : A 2D array representing the constraint matrix G in the quadratic
            programming formulation.

    c : A 1D array representing the constraint vector h in the
            quadratic programming formulation.

    dimensions : The dimensionality of the space in which
            the optimisation is being performed.

    Returns:
    --------
    The optimal projection of the point, subject to the constraints,
    which minimises the quadratic objective function.

    Notes:
    ------
    This function uses the `quadprog_solve_qp` method to solve
    the quadratic programming problem.
